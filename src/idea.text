For the ants, was thinking if we set __init__ with position , destination and owner. Then with the update work out the difference between the position and destination and use that to move them all at a constant speed. As well when they get to the destination and don't die/adsorbed they orbit around the destination. This will be for any mouse click no matter where it is.
